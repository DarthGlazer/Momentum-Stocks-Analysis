# Momentum-Stocks-Analysis
This is a simple project that I might expand upon in the future. It was done for the final project in one of my 1st semester classes in my Analytics Masters at Georgia Tech. It compares taking the top momentum plays each month from the SP500 vs just holding the ETF. In short - momentum plays tend to win, and this analysis explores exactly that.
